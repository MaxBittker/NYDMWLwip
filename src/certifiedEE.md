# Certified, Standardized, Bankable Energy Efficiency Delivered to Market

NY Doing More with Less participants benefit from the quality-assurance, efficient-markets role played by the Investor Confidence Project (ICP), a project of the [Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)](https://www.edf.org) that defines a clear roadmap from retrofit opportunity to reliable [Investor Ready Energy Efficiency](http://www.eeperformance.org/project-certification.html)(TM). With a suite of Commercial and Multifamily [Energy Performance Protocols](http://www.eeperformance.org/project-development.html) in place, ICP reduces transaction costs by assembling existing standards and practices into a consistent and transparent process that promotes efficient markets by increasing confidence in energy efficiency as a demand-side resource.

Working with its active [allied organizations](http://www.eeperformance.org/), the Investor Confidence Project is enabling a marketplace for building owners, project developers, utilities, public programs and investors to trade in standardized energy efficiency projects.

Importantly, NYSERDA is working with the EDF to further develop and strengthen the ICP [Investor Ready Energy Efficiency](http://www.eeperformance.org/project-certification.html)(TM) project protocol for consideration as either the standard technical requirement, alternative compliance pathway, or best practice across all applicable programs.

## Certification Process for Investor Ready Energy Efficiency(TM)
The ICP Quality Assurance (QA) process implemented by [Credentialed QA Providers](http://www.eeperformance.org/how-does-qa-credentialing-work.html) is an integral part of the creation of IREE projects and associated increased confidence by project stakeholders. The ICP System requires verification by ICP Credentialed Quality Assurance Providers, who have been vetted by ICP, to ensure that they possess all necessary qualifications and certifications to provide Quality Assurance for a project developed according to the ICP Energy Performance Protocols.

All NY Doing More with Less projects are IREE certified by an independent, objective, credentialed ICP QA Provider.
