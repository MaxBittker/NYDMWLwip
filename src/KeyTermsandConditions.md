# NY Doing More with Less(TM) RENEW* ESA Key Terms and Conditions

## General

* A RENEW Energy Service Agreement (ESA) is a service contract
* It is not a lease or other debt obligation
* It has no impact on the building owner’s credit rating or balance sheet
* It can be understood as, and treated just like, a utility service charge
* The building owner’s obligations are limited to:
* Coordination during the project development; and
* Paying for the energy savings produced by the project (ESA payments)
* **The ESA payment obligation is tied to the project’s reduced energy use!**
* Building owners benefit from a one-year optimization period to confirm the savings
* Savings are confirmed through a trusted monitoring and verification process
* RENEW signs an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with the Design-Build/Energy Service Provider (E-Firm) to guarantee savings

## Project Ownership and End of Term Disposition
* RENEW owns the project and all environmental attributes associated with the project and:
* Pays the insurance and maintenance expenses
* Has the obligation to maintain and insure the assets unless otherwise negotiated in an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) protocol
* Has the ability to propose to owner additional improvements for the purpose of optimizing building performance and increasing savings, encouraging mutually beneficial practices
* Building owner has the option to either extend the term of the ESA for a defined period or purchase the project at then-current Fair Market Value

## Fixed Payment Obligation
* **Building owner’s ESA payments are less than the energy savings**
* For each year of the term, the ESA sets a fixed rate for each unit of energy saved, which are called Energy Service Units (ESUs)
* The rate for each Energy Services Unit (ESU) is less than the customer has been paying for energy
* RENEW and the building owner agree in the ESA on the owner’s project baseline (pre-retrofit) energy use and on the project forecasted energy use savings, with three savings verification options:

### Option 1) Fully Stipulated Savings (lowest cost option)
* Calculated by the E-Firm with agreed upon forecasted ESUs and confirmed during commissioning
* Savings are based on transparent, industry standard protocols supported by NY Doing More with Less methodology

### Option 2) Stipulated Savings with a One-Year Optimization Period
* Includes an Measurement & Verification (M&V) protocol that is implemented for the first full year of operation
* During the first year the building owner makes ESA payments based on an agreed upon forecasted ESUs savings
* At the end of the first year, the EPC partnering E-Firm provides a report based on the M&V protocol and the measured and verified performance of the project
* The volume of ESUs is adjusted according to actual measured performance, fixing the ESA payments for the remainder of the term on the basis of the actual 12-month-measured project performance
* Projects benefit from unprecedented levels of accuracy and transparency in energy performance assessment and reporting, leveraging world-class, industry-defining measurement best practices and proven technologies

### Option 3) Stipulated Savings with an Annual Optimization Process (highest cost option)
* Includes an M&V protocol that requires an ongoing M&V process that measures the annual delivered savings and adjusts the ESA payments accordingly

## Monitoring and Verification; Reconciliation
* Building owners and RENEW agree upon the monitoring equipment and measurement and verification (M&V) protocols to be used for measuring and metering delivered ESUs
* M&V transparency and best practices are paramount, assuring accuracy and fairness
* Building owners have access to any and all performance data collected
* As noted above, in Options 2 and 3, the EPC partner, on behalf of RENEW, calculates the actual energy savings achieved by the project during its first year, in accordance to the M&V protocol, and produces a report that identifies whether the projects has achieved it targeted savings
* RENEW reconciles any and all amounts payable by the building owner or the EPC partner and sets the ESA payments for the remainder of the term (or, in Option 3, annually)

## Defaults, Remedies and Dispute Resolution
* Should a building owner default on the ESA, RENEW may either 1) sue to enforce the terms of the ESA; 2) terminate the ESA and remove the project assets; 3) terminate the ESA and abandon the project assets; or 4) terminate the ESA and elect to be paid a liquidated damages amount
* Disputes not resolved through informal negotiations would be submitted to a neutral and otherwise qualified mediator.

## Financial Reporting and Financial Term
* Building owners are required to provide periodic financial reports as a means for monitoring the project investment
* ESA terms typically range from 6 to 10 years, although in some cases the term can be extended out as long as 20 years

## Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contracts (EPCs) with Design-Build/Energy Service Provider (E-Firms)
* In addition to undertaking the construction of the project and (in some cases) guaranteeing the savings, the EPC partner is obligated to insure the assets during construction
* Depending on the financial strength and experience of the EPC partner (E-Firm Partner), a project completion guaranty and/or credit enhancement of the savings guaranty (e.g., an energy savings bond) may be required in order to support the expected project cash flows
