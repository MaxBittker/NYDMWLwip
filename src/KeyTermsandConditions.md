# NY Doing More with Less™ (RENEW*) ESA: Key Terms and Conditions
## General
* An Energy Service Agreement (ESA) is a service contract (and not a lease or other debt obligation) so it has no impact on the building owner’s credit rating or balance sheet
* The building owner’s obligations are limited to:
   * Coordination during the project development; and
   * Paying for the energy savings produced by the project (ESA payments)
* There is no payment obligation if the project does not reduce energy costs!
* Building owners benefit from a one-year optimization period to confirm the savings
* Savings are confirmed through a trusted monitoring and verification process
* RENEW signs an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with the Design-Build/Energy Service Provider (DB/ESP) to guarantee savings

## Project Ownership and End of Term Disposition
* RENEW owns the project and all environmental attributes associated with the project:
   * Pays the insurance and maintenance expenses
   * Has the obligation to maintain and insure the assets unless otherwise negotiated in an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) protocol
   * Has the ability to propose to owner additional improvements for the purpose of optimizing building performance and increasing savings
* Building owner has the option to either extend the term of the ESA for a defined period or purchase the project at Fair Market Value

## Fixed Payment Obligation
* Building owner’s ESA payments are less than the energy savings
* For each year of the term, the ESA sets a fixed rate for each unit of energy saved
* The rate for each Energy Services Unit (ESU) is less than the customer has been paying for energy
* RENEW and the building owner agree in the ESA on the owner’s baseline (pre-retrofit) energy use and on the forecasted savings
* During the first year, the building owner makes ESA payments based on the forecast
* At the end of the first year, the EPC partner (also known as the DB/ESP Partner) provides a report based on the actual performance of the project (using agreed-upon industry standard protocols) and the volume of ESUs is adjusted according to actual project performance
* Projects benefit from unprecedented levels of accuracy and transparency in energy performance assessment, leveraging world-class, industry-defining measurement best practices and proven technologies
* The ESA payments are fixed for the remainder of the term on the basis of that actual project performance
* If the project delivers savings in excess of the forecasted amounts, RENEW and the building owner receive a portion of the “upside”

## Monitoring and Verification; Reconciliation
* Building owners and RENEW agree upon the monitoring equipment and measurement and verification (M&V) protocols to be used for measuring and metering delivered ESUs
* M&V transparency and best practices are paramount, assuring accuracy and fairness
* Building owners have access to any and all performance data collected
* As noted above, the EPC partner, on behalf of RENEW, calculates the actual energy savings achieved by the project during its first year and produces a report that identifies whether the projects has achieved it targeted savings
* RENEW reconciles any and all amounts payable by the building owner or the EPC partner and sets the ESA payments for the remainder of the term

## Defaults, Remedies and Dispute Resolution
* Should a building owner default on the ESA, RENEW may either 1) sue to enforce the terms of the ESA; 2) terminate the ESA and remove the project assets; 3) terminate the ESA and abandon the project assets; or 4) terminate the ESA and elect to be paid a liquidated damages amount
* Disputes not resolved through informal negotiations would be submitted to a neutral and otherwise qualified mediator.

## Financial Reporting and Financial Term
* Building owners are required to provide periodic financial reports as a means for monitoring the project investment
* ESA terms typically range from 6 to 10 years, although the term can be extended out as long as 20 years

## Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contracts (EPCs) with Design-Build/Energy Service Provider (ESPs)
* In addition to undertaking the construction of the project and (in some cases) guaranteeing the savings, the EPC partner is obligated to insure the assets during construction
* Depending on the financial strength and experience of the EPC partner (DB/ESP Partner), a project completion guaranty and/or credit enhancement of the savings guaranty (e.g., an energy savings bond) may be required in order to support the expected project cash flows
