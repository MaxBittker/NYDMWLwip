# NY Doing More with Less™ ESA Approach Explained 

## The NY Doing More with Less (RENEW*) Energy Service Agreement (ESA) Model:
* Can be understood as an innovative version of the highly successful, market-transformational Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) approach

* Offers a funding mechanism/contractual tool for third-party financing and energy service delivery of energy efficiency improvements: building energy retrofits and upgrades

* NY Doing More with Less (RENEW), working with partnering Design-Build/Energy Service Providers, develops, finances, owns, operates, and maintains the energy efficiency measures during the term of the ESA – a model that encourages best practices and the implementation of superior technologies 

* The Building Owner pays for the energy saved (“Negawatts”) as a service – either as a percentage of the utility rate or as a fixed dollar amount per kWh saved

* Building owners have an option to purchase the energy efficiency improvements at the end of the ESA contract for the then-current Fair Market Value
