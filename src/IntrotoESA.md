# Introduction to the RENEW It *Now* NY Energy Services Agreement (ESA)

The RENEW ESA is a full-service, turnkey solution that enables building owners to implement facility energy efficiency retrofits and clean energy improvements without the need for upfront capital, and without adding debt to the balance sheet.

## Under the RENEW ESA:
- RENEW pays all design and construction costs
- RENEW structures each project so that the energy services payments (“ESA payments”) are less than the energy savings: the owner sees positive net cash flow from Day One
- As with a typical utility bill, ESA payments are made for measured quantities of energy units, only in this case the energy units are measured quantities of energy units that are saved – i.e., “Negawatts”
- Each project will include energy information systems and reporting tools that enable the building owner to better manage energy consumption
- Because RENEW owns the project and is simply selling energy savings to the building owner, the building owner can treat the ESA payments as an operating expense
- RENEW subordinates the ESA to the existing mortgage holders, addressing any lender concerns
- At the end of the term, the building owner can buy the project at a nominal price ($1) or renew the ESA

## A RENEW ESA is a one-stop solution for energy systems upgrades and energy infrastructure development:
- Working closely with the building owner to ensure the project meets well-defined business needs, RENEW and E-Firm Partnering Contractor design, build, commission and optimize the project
- RENEW and its E-Firm Partnering Contractor measure and verify the energy savings units
- RENEW and its E-Firm Partnering Contractor maintain the energy efficiency improvements for the full term of the ESA
- Subject to review, RENEW and its E-Firm Partnering Contractor can work with the building owner’s preferred maintenance contractor (if not also the project Partnering Contractor)
- RENEW and its E-Firm Partnering Contractor work with the owner to identify additional savings opportunities over time, which easily can be added to an existing ESA
