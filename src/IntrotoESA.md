# Introduction to the NY Doing More with Less(TM) Energy Services Agreement (ESA)

The NY Doing More with Less Energy Services Agreement (ESA) is a full-service, turnkey solution that enables building owners to implement facility energy efficiency retrofits and clean energy improvements without the need for upfront capital, and without adding debt to the balance sheet. 

## Under the NY Doing More with Less ESA: 
- NY Doing More with Less (RENEW(1)) pays all design and construction costs
- NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) structures each project so that the energy services payments (“ESA payments”) are less than the energy savings: the owner sees positive net cash flow from Day One
- As with a typical utility bill, ESA payments are made for measured quantities of energy units that are saved
- Each project will include energy information systems and reporting tools that enable the building owner to better manage energy consumption
- Because RENEW owns the project and is simply selling energy savings to the building owner, the building owner can treat the ESA payments as an operating expense
- RENEW subordinates the ESA to the existing mortgage holders, addressing any lender concerns
- At the end of the term, the building owner can buy the project or renew the ESA

## A NY Doing More with Less ESA is a one-stop solution for energy systems upgrades and energy infrastructure development:
- Working closely with the building owner to ensure the project meets well-defined business needs, NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) and ESP Partnering Contractor design, build, commission, and optimize the project
- NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) and its ESP Partnering Contractor measure and verify the energy savings units
- NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) and its ESP Partnering Contractor maintain the energy efficiency improvements for the full term of the ESA
- Subject to review, NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) and its ESP Partnering Contractor can work with the building owner’s preferred maintenance contractor (if not also the project Partnering Contractor)
- NY Doing More with Less (RENEW) and its ESP Partnering Contractor work with the owner to identify additional savings opportunities over time, which easily can be added to an existing ESA
