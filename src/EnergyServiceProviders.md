<h2> The Deal Structure </h2>
<ul>
<li> An **ESA** between the Customer and RENEW<sup>(1)</sup> -- creates a Customer payment obligation per unit of energy savings (“Negawatts”<sup>(2)</sup>) delivered to the Customer via the provision of assets that are owned by RENEW; the ESA sets a fixed rate for each unit of energy saved, a rate *less* than the Customer has been paying for energy </li><br>
<li> An Engineering, Procurement and Construction **(EPC)** Contract between ESP and RENEW -- defines the systems and performance of the systems to be installed in order to generate the energy savings for the ESA; capital funding of the EPC Contract is provided by RENEW </li><br>
<li> An Operations & Maintenance **(O&M)** Contract between O&M Partner and RENEW -- provides periodic maintenance of RENEW's owned assets over the term of the ESA </li><br>
</ul>

<small>
(1) *RENEW Energy Partners LLC is the engineering, financing, and contractual partner to all participants in the NY Doing More with Less Program.*
<br>
(2) *Amory Lovins coined the term "Negawatt" to refer to a theoretical unit of energy saved through increased energy efficiency.*
