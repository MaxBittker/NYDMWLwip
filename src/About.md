NY Doing More with Less is a joint venture between RENEW Energy Partners LLC and Green Bank Partners, with essential support from the NY Green Bank and RIT’s Golisano Institute for Sustainability.

Focused on building a more innovative business ecosystem for energy efficiency throughout New York State, our enterprise primarily works with Design-Build firms/Energy Service Providers (ESPs) to help them leverage our innovative deal structure and funding platform to better serve and grow the marketplace with a turnkey energy-efficiency-as-a-service contracting approach.

Working in partnership with ESPs, we help business owners and managers to better understand, *trust*, and successfully leverage energy efficient technologies, project management, and innovative financing to generate positive cash flow from day one of a building upgrade or energy infrastructure project.
